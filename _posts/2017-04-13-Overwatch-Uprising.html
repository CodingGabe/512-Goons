<h1>Week 3 - Overwatch: Uprising</h1>

<p>Ayyy, welcome back. Thanks for joining us once again. This week, we play the awesome new Overwatch event, <a href="https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/events/uprising/">Uprising</a>. This event is exciting because it brings us a step closer to what a campaign
    feels like on this amazing platform. It also uncovers a little more on the mysterious backstory's of what happened during the war and each characters development.</p>

<p>You'll notice that Ana and Reyes are good and have a different personaility, leaving us to believe this could be taking place before the events of the game are taking place. The beginning of the Uprising, if you will. We have yet to uncover the other
    team, called Blackwatch but we will continue to fight through until we do. So enjoy our stream as we try and beat hard mode.</p>

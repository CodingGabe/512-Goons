<h1>Week 5 - Rocket League </h1>

<p>The young goons from the 512 are at it again, this time having some fun in <a href="https://www.rocketleague.com/">Rocket League</a>.</p>

<p>Rocket League is a fun and exciting packed sports like game to which a red team and a blue team compete to have the most goals by the end of time limit.
Standard matches are 3v3, 5 minute time limit and plays like soccer. You drive cars with nitro attached and can do any crazy trick to get the ball in the other teams goal.
There are other new and exciting modes like Basketball, and now Hockey. Join us as we show off what we can do versus some funny teams online.</p>

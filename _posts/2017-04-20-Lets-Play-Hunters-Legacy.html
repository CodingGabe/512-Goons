<h1>Week 4 - Hunter's Legacy </h1>

<p>All hail the warrior kitty. Hunter's Legacy is a 2D Metroidvania platformer starring Ikki, a fierce cat who must save the kingdom of Iripur from the evil Morodir.
   The game features a non-lineal design where the focus is on exploration and combat in an open world filled with different characters, enemies, and collectibles.</p>

<p>It features your traditional hack and slash fun, and really feels great. The controls are easy
to pick up and the graphics are nice and lag free. It differs from other platformers like it, in that
it stars a cat so it implentents funny cat moves. The game dives right into it without any instuction requiring
you to think. As you can see in this stream, the intro level is pretty long and I look forward to beating it.</p>

<p>That's right, you heard it here first, <a href="https://twitter.com/Overcookedgame?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Overcooked: Special Edition</a> launches for the Nintendo Switch this Thursday for $19.99/€19.99</p>
<p>Overcooked: Special Edition, developed by the genius' at Team17 features the Overcooked base game along with The Lost Morsel and Festive Seasoning DLC. HD Rumble is also supported. What's included?  This: </p>


<ul>
    <li>44 campaign levels which can be played solo or couch co-op with up to 4 players</li>
    <li>9 versus levels to play head to head locally with either 2 or 4 players</li>
    <li>22 different chefs to play as. Choose a human, racoon, dinosaur, French bulldog, robot or even a reindeer in your quest for culinary greatness!</li>

</ul>


<p>Overcooked includes a campaign mode that can be played solo, as well as local cooperative play for up to four players and a versus mode for two or four players and I am very excited about this one ever since Nintendo dropped that trailer during their Indie Direct.

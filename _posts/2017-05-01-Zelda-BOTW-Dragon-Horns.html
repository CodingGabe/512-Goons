<h1>Tips - Easy spots to hunt those Dragon horns</h1>

<p>In this video, I share a quick way to grab the dragon horns required to updgrade the Champion's tunic or sell for 300 Rupee's.
 Not shown is Farosh, however he can be seen in the morning at Lake Hylia and is the easiest to farm his horns.</p>

 <p>Just travel back in forth between these locations as I noticed that waiting another day in the same spot didnt respawn the dragon.</p>

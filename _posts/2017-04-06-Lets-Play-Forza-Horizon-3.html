<h1>Week 2 - Forza Horizon 3</h1>

<p>Welcome back, this week we decided to play the best looking game on the Xbox One,
<a href="https://forzamotorsport.net/en-US/games/fh3">Forza Horizon 3</a>. The visuals are
just absolutely amazing and the game runs at a native 1080 at 60fps. Really shows off what
the Xbox One can do. This will also be the first big port for the newly announced Project Scorpio.
At the time of this post it is called Project Scorpio, however the official name will be
announced at E3. Anyway, enough talking, check out our let's play as we show off our dope
rides.</p>

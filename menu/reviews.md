## Hunter's Legacy - Review in progress

It features your traditional hack and slash fun, and really feels great. The controls are easy
to pick up and the graphics are nice and lag free. It differs from other platformers like it, in that
it stars a cat so it implentents funny cat moves. The game dives right into it without any instuction requiring
you to think. As you can see in this stream, the intro level is pretty long and I look forward to beating it.

Final Verdict: _In Progress_**
